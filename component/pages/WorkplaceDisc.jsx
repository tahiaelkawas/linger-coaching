            Cooperation and teamwork are key elements of workplace performance.
            An awareness of DISC (Dominance, Influence, Steadiness, and
            Conscientiousness) profiles has been proven to be an essential
            component to unlocking self-awareness and guiding positive change in
            your job. Throughout this course, you will learn strategies to
            increase connection with your peers, use team-centered language and
            identify advantages that can be harnessed by you and your team. The
            modules of this course are specifically designed to be applied in
            the workplace and professional settings.
