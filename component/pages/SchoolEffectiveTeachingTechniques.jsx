          Educational research is showing that the traditional models of teaching are
          becoming redundant in the face of an evolving student demographic. To respond
          to this, it is fundamental to shift the perspectives of teaching to newer and more
          dynamic models of classroom management. Accordingly, issues such as student
          bullying, lack of emotional tolerance from teachers, and an inability to mindfully
          manage deviant behavior still plagues many teachers who identify with traditional
          models of education. Throughout this workshop of effective teaching, you will
          discover the modern models of teaching and learn evidence-based methods that
          will help you navigate difficult environments with ease.
