            Conflict in the workplace is a complex process that can either be a
            source of damage or growth in your job where the deciding factor for
            these outcomes stems from how conflict is resolved between the two
            parties. To promote the latter (i.e., growth) an employee needs to
            be able to listen, empathize, communicate, and execute skills in
            accordance with a given situation. Throughout this course, you will
            learn the necessary skills to be able to resolve conflict
            productively and efficiently. Once completed, you will have the
            confidence to apply the information you have learned and thrive in
            your respective field.
