            The way you treat your children is oftentimes a reflection of your
            internal state. To become a model parent, it is important to have a
            strong awareness of your emotions and understand how to relate them
            to your children as this is what they will assimilate throughout
            their growth. This course will guide you through the various steps
            that you will need to face in order to optimize your
            social-emotional learning (SEL) to benefit not only your child but
            the relationship between the both of you.
