          De-escalation refers to the process of defusing conflicts before they develop into
          harmful situations. School is an environment that is accompanied by frequent behavioral
          outbursts that have the potential to disrupt the learning and functioning of other
          students. De-escalation is key to maintaining a productive learning environment and it
          is an important skill to learn. Throughout this course, you will learn the various de-
          escalation techniques that have been used throughout educational settings and learn
          how to apply them to different scenarios.
